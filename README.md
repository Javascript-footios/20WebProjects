Created by Brad Traversy

3. The Code

All of the code for every project is available in the Github repo at:

https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects

Any images, videos, assets that are needed will always be in this repo. I will also be adding the code to the sections as well.

General:

- `<section>` is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality,
- `<article>` is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. Think of it this way - if you have a number of items of content, each of which would be suitable for reading on their own, and would make sense to syndicate as separate items in an RSS feed, then `<article>` is suitable for marking them up.

- For the exchange rate calculator, we have to sing in and get an API key [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/dashboard)

8. ### Meal Finder

- As about `<div class="meal-info" data-mealID="${meal.idMeal}">` check: [Using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)
